    """
    ACCURACY_PERCENT = 11
    """
    This determines how accurately a unit can aim at another unit

    - Notes:

        This accuracy is the accuracy of a unit to fire at the exact centre of its target. If the shot fired is not aimed at the exact centre of the target, it may still hit the target if its not off by too much since it can still land within the hitbox of the target, just not at the exact centre
        Thus, bigger targets are actually easier to hit, which explains why buildings are an easier target to hit for trebuchets than small units
        In this image, you can see that shots that were fired in the red area in the 2nd scenario would've hit if the target had been closer like in the first scenario, but since the target is far away, they actually miss
        More technically, the visual angle of an object of the same size that is farther away is smaller, thus giving a smaller room for error for the shot in terms of the range of angles that will make the shot hit
        The chance of a unit getting converted by a monk is also determined by its accuracy
        If you modify an onager to have a big blast radius and give it a small accuracy, then attack a lot of units bunched together, the accuracy determines what percentage of units take damage from the blast of the onager! This is the reason why warwolf trebuchets get 100% accuracy because otherwise the blast wouldn't damage all of the units. Another interesting consequence of this is the delete trick with onagers and mangonels. This is where a mangonel is deleted immediately after it fires its shot and because a dead unit doesn't have an accuracy, it defaults to 100% and thus deals more damage to all the units in the blast radius
        
        There are two other factors that play a role in determining the damage from the shot fired by the deleted mangonel
        
        1. The damage from a mangonel's shot is decreased over distance when moving outward from the centre of the blast (the targeted point). However, when the mangonel is deleted, this decrease over distance doesn't happen, and the projectile deals the full 100% damage to all the units in the blast radius!
        2. A shot that is fired from lower elevation would normally deal only 75% of its normal damage due to the elevation damage reduction. deleting a mangonel in this case also makes the damage the full 100% as if there was no elevation difference

    - Notes:

        For example, if we set the hero status of a knight to 2, a monk will not be able to convert it. If we set the hero status of a militia to 4, it will regenerate HP automatically
        What if we want to enable multiple properties at once? This is achieved by adding the flag values for those properties together and setting the hero status to that value. For example, if we want to make a paladin both unconvertable and regenerate HP automatically, we can set its hero status to 2+4 = 6. This means that the hero status of a unit can take on any values in the range 1-63. If you set it to any other value, it does not have any effect on the unit
        This works because notice that there is one and only one way to add different flag values together to obtain a particular value for the hero status! For example, if we have a value of 20 for the hero status of a unit, the only way to make 20 from the above flag values is to add 4 and 16. Thus, we know that the properties corresponding to the flag values 4 (self regeneration) and 16 (protected formation by default) must be enabled for that unit
