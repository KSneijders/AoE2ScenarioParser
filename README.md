## Features:

`AoE2ScenarioParser` allows you to edit **anything** inside a scenario. 
For general usability "managers" have been created to make working with the files easier. 
These managers allow you to quickly change aspects of units, triggers, the map, player data and more!

Below is a simplified overview of some of the features:

|            | Inspect           | Add | Edit | Remove |
|------------|-------------------|-----|------|--------|
| Triggers   | ✔️                | ✔️  | ✔️   | ✔️     |
| Conditions | ✔️                | ✔️  | ✔️   | ✔️     |
| Effects    | ✔️                | ✔️  | ✔️   | ✔️     |
| Units      | ✔️                | ✔️  | ✔️   | ✔️     |
| Map        | n/a *<sup>1</sup> | ✔️  | ✔️   | ✔️     |
| Players    | n/a *<sup>1</sup> | ✔️* | ✔️   | ✔️*    |
| Messages   | n/a               | ✔️  | ✔️   | ✔️     |

*: You can disable or enable players like in the in-game editor (min 1, max 8).  
*<sup>1</sup>: There's no specific inspection function. Though, they can still be printed with clean formatting.
