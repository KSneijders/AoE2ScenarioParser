# Examples

These pages show questions I've been asked and my answers to said questions.
These examples might help you get the hang of it a little faster.

---

I will expand the pages whenever I get more questions (and have time to add them).
If you have any questions, and the docs don't answer them, feel free to send them my way!

Check the support page for up-to-date contact info.

For a **Hello World** example, check out the Hello World page [here](https://ksneijders.github.io/AoE2ScenarioParser/hello_world/).
It includes a complete code block example at the bottom of the page.
