---

## 0.1.35 - 2022-March-3

### Fixed

- Issue introduced after the `0.1.33` fix. 
  - `XS Manager` was trying to create a `script call` effect regardless if the scenario supported it or not.

---

## 0.1.34 - 2022-March-1

### Fixed

- Issue with deepcopying `UuidList`s. (Causing issues with trigger importing). 

---

## 0.1.33 - 2022-February-21

### Fixed

- Issue with `XS Manager` not copying the script content to the right trigger object. 

---

## 0.1.32 - 2022-February-04

### Fixed

- Issue with type hinting `trigger.new_effect` and `trigger.new_condition`

---

## 0.1.31 - 2022-February-02

**Support for the new 58259 update!**   

### Added 

- **The new `Data Triggers` functionality!** A powerful tool to communicate information from in-game to the parser!
  - You can find the `Data Triggers` cheatsheet [here](https://ksneijders.github.io/AoE2ScenarioParser/cheatsheets/data_triggers/)!
- `message` field to the `modify_attribute` effect.

### Improved

- `Area.to_chunks()` function is now **A LOT** faster in certain situations (sometimes 40x faster!)

### Fixed

- Issue with reading the new scenario files (since update 58259, 31-Jan-22)
- Issue with imported triggers not being deep-copied and causing reference problems
- Issue with copied triggers not being able to use `new_effect` and `new_condition`
- Issue where `get_unit_in_area` params `x2` and `y2` were considered exclusive 
  - Locations: `(0, 0), (3, 3)` would be considered like: `(0, 0), (2, 2)`

---

## 0.1.30 - 2022-January-04

### Fixed

- Issue with reading older scenarios (older than 1.40)

---

## 0.1.29 - 2022-January-03

**Happy new year!**

### Added

- **The `Area` object! A powerful object for area management!**
  - You can find the `Area` cheatsheet [here](https://ksneijders.github.io/AoE2ScenarioParser/cheatsheets/area/)!

- Issue where `typing_extensions` wasn't downloaded automatically through pypi (pip)
- Final print statement not ending with a newline

### Changed

- `i_to_xy` function returns named tuple. Can now **also** access the coords using `.x` and `.y`
- `Tile` object to be (simple) (x, y) `NamedTuple` instead of an entire object
  - Note: This is not about `TerrainTile` objects from the Map Manager.

---

## 0.1.28 - 2021-November-19

### Added

  - Deprecation warning to the `create_hill` function
- `map_manager.terrain_2d`
  - A property which returns the map in a 2D list.
  - **Note:** This is calculated for each request so it's recommended to call it once and store it
- `map_manager.get_tile_safe()`
  - Same as `get_tile` except it won't throw an `IndexError` when the tile cannot be found.  
  Instead, it returns `None`
- Datasets from the nitpicked pull: [#18] (newtonerdai).
  - `StartingAge`
  - `Civilization`
- `ColorId` dataset for setting the player color in the player manager
- The palisade gate to the building dataset (`BuildingInfo.PALISADE_GATE`) for disabling the palisade gate

- Support for the new `1.44` scenario version in the current September PUP beta on steam. **(Work in Progress)**
- A cheatsheet for the Map Manager [link](https://ksneijders.github.io/AoE2ScenarioParser/cheatsheets/map/)!
- Scenarios now have a `UUID`. This is used for easy access to information through the entire library.  
This allowed the following:
  - `variable: 0` now shows as: `variable: "NumberOfAttempts" (0)`
  - `trigger_id: 1` now shows as: `trigger_id: "Move units" (1)`
  - `location_object_reference: 222` now shows as:
    ```
    location_object_reference: 1 unit:
        0: Camel Rider [P1, X50.5, Y67.5] (222)
    ```
  - `selected_object_ids: [21, 22]` now shows as: 
    ```
    selected_object_ids: 2 units:
        0: Berserk [P1, X65.5, Y74.5] (21)
        1: Berserk [P1, X66.5, Y75.5] (22)
    ```
- New properties to the `TerrainTile` object
  - `x`:  Get it's X coordinate
  - `y`:  Get it's Y coordinate
  - `xy`:  Get a tuple of it's XY coordinates
  - `i`:  Get it's index
- New functions to the map manager:
  - `get_tile(x=.., y=..)` or `get_tile(i=..)`
  - `get_square_1d(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and `get_square_2d(x1, y1, x2, y2)`  
  Get a square of tiles in a 1D or 2D list.

### Updated

### Fixed

- Functions `xy_to_i` and `i_to_xy` having the x and y coordinate reversed.
- `bidict` still being imported while not being a dependency anymore
- Changing the map size linked all new terrain tiles to the same object
- Error being raised when importing `ProjectileInfo`
- `TimeUnit` dataset values `Years` and `Seconds` being the wrong way around.

### Removed

- `object_location_reference` attribute from the `patrol` effect as it doesn't work in game.

  - Check out the XS cheatsheet [here](https://ksneijders.github.io/AoE2ScenarioParser/cheatsheets/xs/)!
- A **Hello World** example for the parser. You can find it [here](https://ksneijders.github.io/AoE2ScenarioParser/hello_world/).
- `__str__` functions to `TriggerManaer`, `Trigger`, `Effect` and `Condition`
  - You can now do: `print(trigger_manager)` instead of `print(trigger_manager.get_content_as_string())`
- Value representations in `get_content_as_string()`. Shows dataset numerical values as dataset names.
  - `object_list_unit_id: 4` now shows as: `object_list_unit_id: Archer (4)`
  - `technology: 12` now shows as: `technology: Crop Rotation (12)`

[#31]: https://github.com/KSneijders/AoE2ScenarioParser/pull/31

### Fixed

- Typo - `SmartPorjectile` to `SmartProjectile`
- Missing several parameters for specific effects and conditions in `new_effect` and `new_condition`
- Missing several attributes for specific effects and conditions when using `get_content_as_string()`
- `effect.player_color` resulting in the wrong color when assigned using `Player` or `PlayerColor`
- Functions in `unit_manager` requiring `Player`. Just an `int` is also possible now.

They are still available in the effect object, and are split using bitwise operations in the `Effect` object itself.

---

## 0.1.11 - 2021-July-08

## 0.1.0 - 2021-March-25

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** A lot about the library has changed internally. Switching from `0.0.20` to `0.1.0` should only require you to implement a [couple of important changes].  
Click the link on the line above to find said changes. If you find any bugs please report them on github.

[couple of important changes]: https://github.com/KSneijders/AoE2ScenarioParser/blob/master/resources/md/update_to_0.1.0.md

**SPEED:** This release _should_ improve average reading and writing speed. Some tested scenarios had a read speed improvement of over 15x when using large AI or other text files. Average reading time will be around 20 to 40 percent faster. Writing time has increased significantly too. Maps with large amount of data have around 700% (7x faster) increase in writing time!

### Other changes:

These changes were in the works for `0.0.21` but got merged into the `0.1.0` relesase.

### Added

-   All villagers to the `Unit` dataset as: `VILLAGER_<SEX>[_<PROFESSION>]`
-   A handful of other units to the `Unit` dataset

### Changed

-   Renamed `FLEMISH_MILITIA_M` and `FLEMISH_MILITIA_F` to `FLEMISH_MILITIA_MALE` and `FLEMISH_MILITIA_FEMALE`

### Removed

-   The old names used for villagers (e.g. `BUILDER` or `HUNTER`). (These were male only)
-   The BiDict variable `unit_names`, because the same effect can be achieved using the `.name` attributes in the dataset.
-   The `scenario.create_default()` function.

---

## 0.0.20 - 2021-February-17

### Fixed

-   Issue with reading a very rare scenario file header. Usage of the difference is unknown.
-   Issue with reading the xs script content that was saved to the scenario.
-   Some small effect fields to no longer be set in a list when they were single ints.

## 0.0.15 - 2020-December-18

### Added

-   Support for bitmap images (Can't be seen, used (or removed) in DE but crashed the parser if present)
-   Support for legacy codec `latin-1` (Voobly converted maps). Please note that all text will be written back into `utf-8` when writing a new file.
-   Units to the units dataset (Credis: Alian713)

### Updated

-   Many Attribute ID names and their description and usages. (Credits: Alian713)

### Fixed

-   Error while trying to debug a map with non ASCII characters
-   Reading errors with specific uncommon attributes

### Changed

-   Changed parameter `unit_id` to `unit_const` in the `add_unit` function

---

## 0.0.14 - 2020-November-29

### Added

-   Support for AI files. Since the latest update (42848) AI files are (sometimes) stored differently

### Updated

-   [HTML file] with byte structure (Download to view file. Does not contain JS. Just HTML & CSS)

[html file]: https://github.com/KSneijders/AoE2ScenarioParser/blob/master/resources/personal_docs/file_structure.html

### Fixed

-   Issue with rotation on objects. Mostly affecting cliffs, certain tree types and other rotatable objects

---

## 0.0.13 - 2020-November-27

### Fixed

-   Issue introduced in `0.0.12`

---

## 0.0.12 - 2020-November-27

**Support for the new update!**

**Important notice:** This version does not support older versions of the scenario files. This is temporary due to the amount of changes from the newest version (Update: 42848), sorry for the inconvience.  
When loading a map from an older version, instructions will be provided for downgrading this library or updating the scenario to the newest version.

### Added

-   `create_hill` function to the map_manager (Credits: pvallet)
-   **[Update 42848]** `script_name` (xs file) to the MapManager
-   **[Update 42848]** The new effects!!
    -   `Set Building Gather Point`
    -   `Script Call`
    -   `Change Object Player Color`
    -   `Change Object Civilization Name`
    -   `Change Object Player Name`
    -   `Disable Unit Targeting`
    -   `Enable Unit Targeting`
    -   `Change Technology Cost`
    -   `Change Technology Research Time`
    -   `Change Technology Name`
    -   `Change Technology Description`
    -   `Enable Technology Stacking`
    -   `Disable Technology Stacking`
    -   `Acknowledge Multiplayer AI Signal`
    -   `Disable Object Selection`
    -   `Enable Object Selection`

### Discovered (in byte structure)

-   **[Update 42848]** The new architecture set feature
-   **[Update 42848]** script (xs) file path at the end of the file

### Improved

-   Defaults for the `create_default()` function when dealing with inconsistent structs

### Fixed

-   Adding a trigger with extra arguments will now work properly (Example: `.add_trigger("name", description="desc")`)
-   Adding a condition with extra arguments will now work properly (Example: `.add_condition(Cond.TIMER, timer=20)`)
-   The 'Fix' in version `0.0.11` for the lazy loading of effect and condition display orders wasn't working properly. Now it is.

### Removed

-   `number_of_units_selected` as an attribute for effects. This is now dealt with internally.

---

## 0.0.11 - 2020-November-15

### Added

-   Optional arguments for `create_trigger` function (all trigger parameters except for it's internal ID)
-   Optional arguments for `add_condition` function (all condition parameters)
-   Optional arguments for `add_effect` function (all effect parameters)

### Improved

-   Performance:
    -   Writing the file, combining strings using `str.join(list)` instead of `str += str`
    -   Reusing structs when reconstructing where possible, instead of overwriting all of them.
    -   Not initialising RetrieverDependencies for every retriever. Using references instead.
    -   Reworked the eval functions to direct code, huge performance boost
    -   Removed unnecessary DependencyAction objects creation (From ~500.000 to ~100)
    -   Changed trigger display order, condition display order, effect display order attribute to lazy load

### Fixed

-   The `AoE2Scenario.create_default()` function. (Incorrect defaults caused the file to corrupt)

---

## 0.0.10 - 2020-November-10

### Changed

-   The effect attribute `selected_object_id` to `selected_object_ids` to indicate the use of a list.

### Discovered (in byte structure)

-   The `location_object_reference` property for effects. Used for targeting an object as location. For example in the `TaskObject` effect.

### Fixed

-   The `AoE2Scenario.create_default()` function. (Defaults from structs weren't actually used in the parent Pieces)

---

## 0.0.9 - 2020-November-09

### Fixed

-   All `copy_trigger` related functions take very long to copy per player.

---

## 0.0.8 - 2020-November-08

**Important notice:** The way you read your main file changed. It is now:

    AoE2Scenario.from_file(filename)  # Just add ".from_file". Nothing else changed :)

Also, there has been a massive change to the 'back' portion of the project. If you used this directly, you might need to change quite some code. Sorry :(. If you've got any questions, feel free to reach out. Also, if you encounter any bugs, especially in the new system, please report them! Thanks in advance! <3

### Added

-   `remove_condition()` and `remove_effect()` to TriggerObject
-   `get_condition()` and `get_effect()` to TriggerObject
-   The index and display index to the `trigger.get_content_as_string()`
-   Four very powerful trigger features! Please check the readthedocs [Documentation API], or the function docstrings for the how-to.
    -   `copy_trigger`
    -   `copy_trigger_per_player`
    -   `copy_trigger_tree`
    -   `copy_trigger_tree_per_player`
    -   `replace_player`
-   `commit()` function to objects. This will commit the changes to the piece structure. This is also done for all objects automatically when writing the file.
-   Every object now has `RetrieverObjectLink` objects to represent how to retrieve and commit their data. (These objects also have a commit function, which are called using the objects commit function)
-   The possibility to create a scenario from SCRATCH due to all pieces having default values now! No need for a 'base' scenario file from the game itself! You can achieve this like so: `AoE2Scenario.create_default()`!
-   A `TriggerSelect` object. Used to identify a trigger in the trigger_manager functions. Alias: `TS`. Use Alias + class methods (factory methods) for ease of access: `TS.index(3)`, `TS.display(1)` and `TS.trigger(trigger)`.
-   A `TriggerCELock` object. Used to define which (or all) conditions and effects should be locked while copying/changing players.
-   A `GroupBy` Enum. For selecting the way triggers are grouped after creating them via `copy_trigger_tree_per_player`. You can choose from `NONE` (default), `TRIGGERS` and `PLAYERS`.
-   **A Very much WIP** [Documentation API]

[documentation api]: https://aoe2scenarioparser.readthedocs.io/en/master/

### Discovered (in byte structure)

-   the `layer` property for terrain tiles. Used for layering terrain types.

### Changed

-   **The way a file is read is now done using:** `AoE2Scenario.from_file(filename)`. Nothing changed - just add "_.from_file_" between the class and the brackets :)
-   Within the library the use of `\x00` character for line endings is no longer a necessity.
    -   This mainly affects checking names: (eg. `trigger.name == "name\x00"`) (Credits: Alian713)
-   The parameter `trigger_id` has been renamed to `trigger_index` in all functions in TriggersObject (trigger_manager)
-   Renamend `Operator` to `Operation`.
-   Managers can now be accessed directly from the scenario. Eg: `scenario.trigger_manager`.
-   Renamed `player` attribute in the `Condition` object to `source_player`
-   Renamed `player_source` attribute in the `Effect` object to `source_player`
-   Renamed `player_target` attribute in the `Effect` object to `target_player`
-   Renamed `find_retriever` function to `get_retriever_by_name`
-   Renamed all retriever names to be lowercase underscored (Credits: pvallet)
-   Progress print statements now replace their current line. So instead of using 2 lines per piece it's now 1.
-   Most trigger_manager functions now require the new `TriggerSelect` object instead of 3 parameters for trigger selection. Read the docstring for more detail.

### Fixed

-   Bug causing the local `trigger_id` attributes to be out of sync when removing triggers.
-   Bug causing the `ValueError` to not get raised when trying to construct a piece with invalid data length.
-   Bug causing `Conditions` and `Effects` not to show in 'get_as_string' functions when set directly using: `trigger.effects = [...]`
-   Bug causing a crash when `selected_object_id` in `Effects` held a single ID.
-   Bug causing a crash when setting `selected_object_id` to an uniterable object. (Like an int instead of List[int])
-   Bug causing Variables to not show up when no triggers were present when using the `get_summary_as_string` in the trigger_manager.
-   Bug making it impossible to set unit IDs negative. (Supported by the game)
-   Typo in Condition dataset "OWH" to "OWN" in `OWH_FEWER_OBJECTS`.
-   Typo in Terrain dataset "MAGROVE" to "MANGROVE" in `FOREST_MAGROVE`.

### Removed

-   Outdated examples

---

## 0.0.7 - 2019-May-23

### Added

-   The `ai_script_goal` effect.
-   The `difficulty_level` condition.
-   The `new_unit_id_to_place` field in the `DataHeader` is updated in the reconstructing phase.
-   VariableObject: `{id: ..., name: ...}`.
-   Variable info to `get_content_as_string` and `get_summary_as_string` functions from the trigger_manager.
-   `get_variable(id or name)` function to the trigger_manager.
-   Defaults to all `effects` & `conditions`. (In-Game Editor defaults)
-   PlayerColor Enum. `PlayerColor.PURPLE`.
-   The ability to remove units using `unit_mamager.remove_unit(unit=... or reference_id=...)`.
-   The abiltiy to remove a trigger using an object reference: `trigger_manager.remove_trigger(trigger=...)`.
-   `Hero` dataset (Credits to [T-West] for the hero name list)
-   `get_enum_from_unit_const` function
-   `GaiaBuilding` and `GaiaUnit` dataset (Like normal Building and Unit dataset but also includes Gaia only buildings & units)
-   Datasets for (All?) dropdown lists in conditions and effects.
    -   `DiplomacyState`
    -   `Operator`
    -   `ButtonLocation`
    -   `PanelLocation`
    -   `TimeUnit`
    -   `VisibilityState`
    -   `DifficultyLevel`
    -   `TechnologyState`
    -   `Comparison`
    -   `ObjectAttribute`
    -   `Attribute`
-   **Code Block** - Added code block for adding KOTH + Regicide to any map with (exactly) one monument - Using triggers. This code block adds close to 600 triggers for displaying all years, displaying players holding the monument and victory & defeat conditions.

### Changed

-   `ChangedVariableStruct` to `VariableStruct`.
-   UnitObject attribute `unit_id` renamed to `unit_const`. (Credit: [T-West])
-   Effects and Condition constants are now `IntEnum`s. (ie. `Effect.CREATE_OBJECT`)
-   Units, Buildings, Techs and Terrains are now `IntEnum`s. (ie. `Unit.MAN_AT_ARMS`)
-   Renamed `delete_trigger` function to `remove_trigger`.
-   Renamed `trigger_data` attribute to `triggers`
-   Reading and Writing UTF-8 instead of ASCII characters. (The game might not support all characters everywhere)

### Updated

-   `Snow`, `Ice, Navigable`, `Beach, Ice` in Terrain dataset. (Fixed in game)

### Fixed

-   `get_new_reference_id()` returns `highest_id + 1` instead of `highest_id`.
-   Bug removing all `Trigger` names.
-   Bug causing `Trigger display order` to be incorrect. Wasn't breaking scenarios as the in-game editor was able to handle it properly and fixed it when saving from there. Only caused the Parser from being able to read the file.

### Removed

-   The default attributes in `Condition` and `Effect` constructors.
-   The `get_triggers` function. It was redundant as it's equal to the following:
    -   0.0.6: `trigger_manager.trigger_data`
    -   0.0.7: `trigger_manager.triggers`
